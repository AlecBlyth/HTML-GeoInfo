<p>After the Empire</p>
<p>After the Second World War The European Empires were unable to keep hold of their colonies. The British Empire rather than spend more money and use up more resources to fight a possible rebellion in India, they decided to dissolve British Raj.</p>
<p>This however, may have been what India wanted, the results were costly.</p>
<p>India, Pakistan, Burma and Bangladesh (which was under Pakistan rule) were new countries.</p>
<p>Due to the high population of Muslims in North India and Bangladesh, Pakistan asserted that they were the rightful rulers over Northern India and Bangladesh </p>
<p>This has caused war between the two nations fighting over territory. </p>
<p>This resulted in a mutal distrust between India and Pakistan, that even today both nations are on the brink of war agianst each other.</p>
