<p>Tonga  is an archipelago which includes a total of 177 islands near Australasia,  although under the influence of the British Empire, it was left alone and  remained independent to this day. However this can be debated due to them being  a Protectorate of the British Empire which gives the Crown absolute power for  guaranteed protection by the British Empire which ended in 1970.</p>
<p class="Info">Tonga became known as the &quot;Friendly Islands&quot; This was because when the British Captain, Captain James Cook first visited the islands, he arrived during the time of the festival known as &quot;Inasi&quot; festival, in which the natives yearly donate the first fruits to the islands' paramount chief</p>
